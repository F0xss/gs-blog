## Contributions
Everyone is welcome to make suggestions on how this plugin can be improved by either submitting an issue or a pull-requests.

#### When making pull requests, there are a few simple rules that should be followed.
- Make sure that your fork is up to date with the master first. This helps to prevent conflicts from occuring. A pull request cannot be accepted if there is a conflict.
- All commits must reference a related issue in the comment. For example, "Part of #xx" or "Fixes #xx". If a related issue does not exist, please first create one.
- Code should follow common practises and the standards as set out in this [GetSimple Wiki] (http://get-simple.info/wiki/getsimple_coding) article. This also includes:
  - Indenting of code should consist of 4 spaces, never tabs.
  - Each file should contain an empty line at the end.
  - To make it easier for others to read and understand the code, it is recomended that you space out the code a bit more more. An example is provided below:
    ```php
    if ( exampleFunction( $variable ) ) {
      $exploded = explode( $variable );
    } else {
      $imploded = implode( $variable );
    }
    
    // Note the spacing around brackets.
    // Curly braces should remain on the same line as the 'if' or 'else' statements.
    ```

Acceptance of pull requests is at the descretion of the repository manager. All contributions to this repositiory will be appropriatly credited where possible.
