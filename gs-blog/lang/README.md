## Language Files
Language files are initally generated automatically using the `translator.php` script on the command line, using the Google Translate API. They can then be edited by contributor to correct any translation inaccuracies. 

When new strings are added with features, they are added only to the en\_US.php file, then the translator script is run again. The script will only append new strings to the existing files, and by doing so reserves the string already present and corrected, preventing the need to re-correct the strings each time.

## Contributing Language Corrections
If you would like to contribute to correcting strings in any of the language file, you are most welcome to, but please ensure that you follow the guidelines in the CONTRIBUTING.md document. Please also refrain from modifying the layout of the file as it will not persist across regeneration of the file after running the translator script.

Contributors will be credited in this readme in the section below, and in the readme in the root of this repositoroy.
