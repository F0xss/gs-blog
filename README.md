I have taken is upon myself to maintain this plugin, as there are a number of known issues (many of which have been fixed in this version) and it appears to no longer have support from it original author. I welcome any and all suggestions for future improvements, and if you find any further bugs, then please let me know. I have scoured the GetSimple Forum for as many bug reports as I could find, and I have done my best to fix as many as I can in this version.

### Future Versions
As I continue to develop this plugin further, I will be adding more new features, including:

**Short-term Plan:**
- Refinements to Admin panel including:
  splitting settings into multiple pages instead of one long page
- Compatibility with Facebook Integration plugin (also developed by me)
  eg. Posting to blog will also automatically post to Facebook page.
- Support for custom comments providers
- Ability to show/hide host page in blog url (aimed at IIS users)
- Extend API support - For update checking. - Implemented in Version 3.1

**Long-term Plan:**
- Internationalisation (i18n) support
- Integration with a Website Search plugin
  (maybe i18n Serach (might not be possible), maybe something else)
