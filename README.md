I have taken is upon myself to maintain this plugin, as there are a number of known issues (many of which have been fixed in this version) and it appears to no longer have support from it original author. I welcome any and all suggestions for future improvements, and if you find any further bugs, then please let me know. I have scoured the GetSimple Forum for as many bug reports as I could find, and I have done my best to fix as many as I can in this version.
